title: Jake Keogh for Knox

  Our wonderful local community is growing and appropriate development in the area is crucial for our community to continue to thrive. Inflated house prices and a shortage of properties are forcing our younger generation further away from their families and from the opportunity to live locally. We need to take action to ensure that the people of Knox have access to affordable housing and have the opportunity to live in this great area. We must strive to ensure that vibrancy and the beauty of the foothills is preserved for generations to come.

    I believe strongly in the need for fair rates for all residents. I will work closely with the ratepayers association of Knox to protect the current cap on rate increases and to ensure that ratepayers are consulted before there are any proposed changes in the future.

    It is only through living in such a great area that you see how important the local fabric of community is. I will continue to work with our fantastic local football clubs, cricket clubs, netball teams, CFA, scouts, theatres and the many other unique organisations that make this area great. Together we can continue to appropriately evolve the foothills so that we keep our wonderful sense of community and maintain the reputation we have as one of the most beautiful areas in Victoria to live.

    As someone that has grown up and gone to school in Ferntree Gully, I believe that a change in the council to allow for greater community input and involvement is desperately needed.

  <p>
    We can:
    <ul>
      <li>create a more community involved council</li>
      <li>ensure we have appropriate development</li>
      <li>keep our rates down</li>
      <li>support and grow our local organisations</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, letâ€™s give Dobson a fresh perspective!
