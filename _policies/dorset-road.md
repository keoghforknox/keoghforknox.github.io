If the residents of Rowville, Lysterfield, Boronia, Ferntree Gully and beyond want to get rid of daily traffic bottle-necks then its time for a change at their council. Over 30 years ago there was a plan to extend Dorset Road and this was unanimously supported by residents, but still to date, no work has even started. 

Cars travelling south are forced to divert when they reach the end of Dorset road and take routes such as Glenfern road to access Lysterfield. This results in severe congestion in places such as the roundabout where Brenock Park Drive, Glenfern road and Cornhill street intersect. Anyone who drives through this area in peak hour will know that to drive a kilometre is a half an hour long commitment, at least. That is not fair and council can do better. In an emergency situation, such as a fire on the mountain. Evacuating residents would not be able to be achieved quickly enough as we currently do not have the road network to support a timely large scale evacuation. This is a severe concern and it must be addressed. 

The solution is simple, build the Dorset road extension. Land for this extension was purchased over 30 years ago, with 8 Kevin Avenue in Ferntree Gully being acquired in the 1970s. So why have council and current councillor Karin Orpen only talked about this issue but never delivered action? We need a council of action, not more delay. 

It is time for change, and time for new thinking. The people of Dobson Ward deserve better. If elected, I will be advocating and fighting for the Dorset road extension to be put back on the agenda and finally deliver a promise that was made 30 years ago that the people deserve. 

If you believe it is finally time for action to see the Dorset road extension delivered then sign the petition below and show you support. 
It is time to give Dobson a fresh perspective.
