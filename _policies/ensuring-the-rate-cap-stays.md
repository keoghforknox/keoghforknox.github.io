Over the past 12 years rates have increased on average 50.5% for Knox Council residents. That equates to an average of a 4.2% per year. Increases have steeply risen in recent years: to 17.2% over 2010-2011 and 23% over 2013-2014.

During 2013-14 did your wage increase by 23%? Or during 2010-2011 did you feel as if the council services increased by 17.2%? So why are our rate increases so dramatically above what we earn and below what we get?

Rates are needed in our community to ensure that council can deliver certain services, and we all acknowledge that. 
However, if rates are to increase by such significant amounts, then the services delivered by the council should be increased to reflect this. 

However, over recent years many services have been decreased. The hard rubbish service have been made less frequent. Council run childcare facilities now have longer waiting lists. Sporting facilities are not receiving the upgrades they need to support increased participation in sport—especially with the rise of women’s and all abilities sport. These are but some of the many examples that have occurred during these massive rates increases. Where is that extra ratepayer money going?

If elected, I will ensure that the services that have diminished will be reviewed and I will advocate for the residents of Knox to get the services they are entitled to and have paid their rates for. I will also fight to ensure that if the residents approve any rate increases, that money is put directly into services that will better our community.

We also need to ensure the rate cap stays. Wages and the pension are not increasing enough per annum to meet any higher increases. I will advocate to keep the rate cap and ensure greater scrutiny on what services ratepayers money is being spent on, to ensure that your ratepayer money is not wasted. 

I will be working with the Ratepayers Association of Knox to ensure that the rate cap stays, or that any increases in rates goes directly to services that the community wants and needs. The community deserve to know where the money they pay for rates is going and I will be advocating for transparency in ensuring that the ratepayers are not hurt anymore by unfair rate increases.
