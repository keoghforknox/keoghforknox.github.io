As it currently stands, residents do not have an adequate opportunity to voice their concerns and opinions to councillors. The opportunity to vote out under-performing councillors at an election only comes around once every four years. That is simply not often enough: why arenâ€™t our councillors accountable to their residents all the time?

The only real way to get directly in contact with councillors is to call or email them directly. But what happens if they fail to reply? I have spoken to residents of Ferntree Gully who report that their current councillor has not replied to their emails for months. The current system has failed to keep Dobson Ward's current councillor accountable to ratepayers.

If elected, I will establish quarterly community ward meetings and workshops. This would allow residents the chance to speak directly to their council once every few months and to express their issues, concerns or talk about anything they think is working in our community. All councillors should be directly accountable to the people that elect them. In recent years this has not been the case, but your vote can change that and allow every resident the chance to speak up and be heard. 

We live in a great community, and every resident should have the chance to have their say. Whether your feedback is positive or negative, you deserve a councillor that will listen to what you have to say and give you the chance to speak.
