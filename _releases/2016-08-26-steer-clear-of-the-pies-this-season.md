Victorians are being reminded that some bird species, including Australian Magpies (Cracticus tibicen), may start to swoop people as part of their normal breeding behaviour.

As the weather starts to warm up, birds may start to swoop to defend their eggs and young if they perceive people to be a potential threat.

The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) is encouraging people to notify others in their local area about swooping birds.

This will make the community aware of  swooping hotspots throughout Victoria.

Australian Magpies and Masked Lapwings (Vanellus miles) may start to swoop this month, and that will increase next month.

While the best way to avoid being swooped is to avoid the area all together, this isn’t always possible. If you are in a location where there is a swooping bird, try to protect your head and eyes and move quickly through the area.

Whether you live in the city or the bush, we share our environment with native birds and people must remember not to harm them because they are protected under the Wildlife Act.

To report a swooping incident, visit Victoria’s Magpie Map: [http://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/environment-and-wildlife/wildlife/swooping-birds](http://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/environment-and-wildlife/wildlife/swooping-birds)

**Quotes attributable to Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio**

"Being swooped by a territorial bird can be a scary experience, but this is just normal bird behaviour and, if possible, the best solution is to keep away."

"If you do get swooped, or see a bird swooping, please report it on Victoria’s Magpie Map so the community knows about it and can try to avoid the area."
