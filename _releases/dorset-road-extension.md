Ever experienced peak hour traffic in the middle of Melbourne’s hustling CBD? These days you don't have to go far for such an experience: residents of Knox City Council are sick of the traffic between Lysterfield and Ferntree Gully. They’re also concerned about the dangers posed by motorists speeding down side streets in attempts to beat the morning and afternoon peak hour traffic.

There is a solution: building the Dorset Road extension. The extension has been talked about by current councillor Karin Orpen for over twenty years. It remains unbuilt. If the residents of Rowville, Lysterfield, Boronia, Ferntree Gully and beyond want to get rid of daily traffic bottle-necks then its time for a change at their council.

“Knox City Council residents are sick of ever-worsening traffic congestion on their daily commutes. They need action, not more delay. It’s time someone stood up for the residents. Thats why I’m running for Dobson Ward.

"It’s time for change. It’s time for new thinking” says candidate Jake Keogh

Candidate Jake Keogh and local residents will be staging a protest at the corner of Dorset Rd and Burwood Hwy at 4pm on Tuesday the 6th of September. For more information please call Jake on {{ site.contact.mobile }} or email: {{ site.contact.email }}
