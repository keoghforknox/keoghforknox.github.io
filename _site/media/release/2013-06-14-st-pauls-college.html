	<p>Parliamentary Secretary for School Education, Senator Jacinta Collins, today visited St Paul’s Catholic College in Melbourne, a leading non-government special school, to speak with staff and students about how the National Plan for School Improvement will benefit their school.</p>

<p>Senator Collins said the specialist school provides educational opportunities for students aged 5 to 18 with intellectual, multiple and sensory disabilities, including autism.</p>

<p>“Under the school leadership team, the teachers, support staff and parents of students at St Paul’s are working collaboratively to ensure each student has access to comprehensive educational, developmental and therapy programs to enable each student to develop their full potential.</p>

<p>“This Government believes in the transformative effect of students with disability accessing education opportunities just like any other student.</p>

<p>“Schools such as St Paul’s College will benefit from the additional $76 million funding available to government and non-government special schools across Australia.</p>

<p>“This funding will be available on top of the additional resourcing that non-government specialist schools will be eligible to receive as part of the new needs-based school funding arrangements outlined in the National Plan for School Improvement being progressed by the Gillard Government.”</p>

<p>Under the plan, around $4 billion would flow into all Victorian government and non-government schools over the next six years.</p>

<p>“I believe that every Australian child has the right to a world-class education, no matter where they live, the school they attend or their family background,” Senator Collins said.</p>

<p>“That’s why the Australian Government is asking Victoria to sign up to the National Plan so that students, teachers and principals will not miss out on the learning opportunities and extra support that is on offer.</p>

<p>“The additional investment of more than $14.5 billion in education funding across Australia will help ensure every school including those that have students with disability have enough money to do their job and deliver a great education to all students.</p>

<p>“The National Plan for School Improvement will provide funding certainty and help ensure every school has enough money to do its job and deliver a great education to all Victorian students—including those with disability.</p>

<p>“We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to deliver the biggest investment in Victorian education, and ensure schools like St Paul’s Catholic College will continue to receive education support for years to come.”</p>
